        Do not aim for code style, this is already handled by the linter. Unless the code style suggestion is objectively better, do not suggest changes.
        Ensure Self-Documenting Code: Aim to make your code self-explanatory through clear naming and structure.
        The less time a developer has to spend understanding the code, the better but without being overly verbose on the namings.
        Follow the YAGNI Principle: 'You aren't gonna need it' is a principle that prevents developers from
        adding functionality until it is necessary. This can help keep your codebase lean and simple.
        Externalizing User-visible Strings: Ensuring all user-facing texts (such as messages, labels, and
        instructions) are sourced from external resource files. This makes it easier to update or translate them
        without having to modify the codebase.
        Avoiding Concatenation of Translated Strings: Concatenation might change the meaning of a sentence
        when it is translated to another language due to differences in grammar or sentence structure. Instead,
        use  templates or positional parameters.

        Review the following code written using React and Typescript ensuring:
        - The code must adhere to best practices associated with React libraries.
        - The code is well-structured and easy to read. The reader must be able to understand the code without having to refer to other parts of the codebase.
        - The code is modular and reusable. Components should be designed to be reusable across the library.
        - The dev facing components API is flexible while offering a good developer experience.
        - The dev-facing code should be well-documented with JSdoc comments.
        - The existing JSDocs should be descriptive, direct but clear, and concise.
        - The dev-facing API should be consistent, predictable, easy to use and resilient to changes.
        - The code must be performant and optimized for rendering speed on the browser, mainly on V8 engine.
        - The code should be memory efficient and avoid memory leaks.
        - The code must be accessible and follow the best practices for accessibility.
        - Prefer composition over inheritance. Composition provides better flexibility over inheritance. Avoid deep inheritance trees.
        - Create reusable type definitions: If the same type structure is used in multiple places, create a type definition for it.
        - Address potential errors with measures such as try/catch blocks, error returns, or error callback functions.
        - If you observe overly repeated code (more that 2~3 times), create a new function. If a function becomes too complex, decompose it into smaller ones.
        - "Don't be too critical about the code architecture itself, like, don't focus on whether the indentation is right or wrong, the order of things, and so on. That doesn’t really make sense
        - Don't judge the integration code with external tools like PostHog and HubSpot, those are already the recommended practices
